## mvcBattleships

This project was done in my free time at work roughly a year ago as a primer to learn mvc, c#, and Visual Studio. This is only an mvp, I would love to do more, but my focused has shifted to learning other technologies. It was a great start and I learned so much, but I've learned much more since then.

My work on battleships in mvc has concluded, but I recently have been working on another battleships project using node and react.

## Instructions to play:

* Open solution (.sln) in Visual Studio 2015
* Use IIS Express feature in Visual Studio
* It should open your default browser and navigate to http://localhost:51560/
* After pressing the "Start" button, you will be brought to the place ships screen
* Decide where you would like to place your ships and press the next button
** Easiest way to move past this screen is to change ship two's column to "2", three's column to "3", etc.
* You will be brought to the main game board
* Click on your opponent's board and press "Fire"
* A miss will be indicated with an "M", a hit with an "X"
* "-" indicates an unexplored location

The AI is hardcoded to place their ships in a specific pattern and fire in a random, non-explored location.
